The inputs are sentences written by a school-age child who is talking to a chatbot. We want three classes of sentences:\\n1. The sentences in which the kid is implying or asking the chatbot to tell him/her a story. \\n2. The sentences which are implying that the child needs help, guidance or advice.\\n3. The sentences which are implying that the child wants to have a casual chat.\\nIt is important to note that the child might not directly ask for a piece of advice or a guidance or a story.  For example, the sentence: 'It would be great if I knew how to play basketball' is categorized in the second class because it is clear that by giving him some advice, we can help him. On the other hand, if the child is expressing his or her problem or negative feeling or difficulty without any sign or indication of seeking help or comment, that sentence belongs the third class. Therefore, building such a dataset requires realistic thinking and subtleties to avoid generating only trivial and obvious sentences.\\n\\nYour task is given one of values: {1, 2, 3}, generate a sentence which belongs to that class and is said by a hypothetical school-age child keeping in mind the details and instructions that were made in this text earlier.\\nTry to make more sophisticated sentences with realistic details. Try not to generate cliche sentences.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nInput : 1\\nOutput: \\\"I'm a little bored. I really want to hear an exciting story\\\"\\n\\nInput : 2\\nOutput: \\\"I really can't tolerate this mean bully! It would be great if someone could help me deal with him\\\"\\n\\nInput : 3\\n\\nOutput: \\\"I really liked what she said about me but I'm still angry at her.\\\"\\n \"\n",

If children want to receive advice or guidance, they either say this directly or they might tell you that they have a problem that they need to face.

Sometimes, based on what they say, they do not particularly want to chat casually and talk about their day, their feelings, their thoughts, etc. \\nSometimes you may confuse whether the user who is expressing a difficulty or a problem, seeks advice or guidance or just wants to talk about their problem.
