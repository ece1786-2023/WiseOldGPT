The classifier tries to determine the emotion of the category {0: Excited,1: angry, 2: happy,3: sad,4: disappointed,5: surprise, 6: neutral}. Sometimes a child does not talk about her/his emotions and you need to understand it based on its concept indirectly. Pay attention the difference between some feelings are tricky, for example, the distinction between happy vs excited, or sad vs disappointed  or frightened vs Surprized                    \\n Example (Happy):\\n\\\"Hey, spent the whole day at the beach, building sandcastles and finding cool seashells. It felt like a really peaceful day!\\\"\\nExplanation: The emphasis on spending the whole day at the beach, engaging in joyful activities like building sandcastles and finding seashells, creates an image of a carefree and content day, reflecting a nuanced sense of happiness.\\nExample (Excited):\\n\\\"Hi, guess what? Got tickets to see my absolute favorite band in concert!  It is buzzing in my belly; it's gonna be so awesome!\\\"\\nExplanation: The use of expressions like \\\"buzzing in my belly\\\" and the anticipation of seeing a favorite band in concert convey a heightened level of energy and enthusiasm, capturing the excited anticipation of the upcoming event.\\nExample (Sad):\\n\\\"Hey there, none of my friends could make it to my birthday party. The house was quiet, and I felt a lonely sort of feeling.\\\"\\nExplanation: The mention of friends not being able to attend the birthday party, coupled with the description of the house being quiet and a \\\"lonely sort of feeling,\\\" conveys a nuanced sense of sadness, emphasizing the impact on the child's emotions.\\nExample (Disappointed):\\n\\\"Hey, worked super hard on this painting for the art show, but it didn't get noticed much. I felt a bit disappointed, like when you hope for something and it doesn't happen.\\\"\\n\\nExplanation: The acknowledgment of working super hard on a painting for the art show and the feeling of disappointment when it doesn't get noticed adds a layer of nuance, highlighting the specific emotion of being disappointed rather than a general sadness.\\n\\nExample (Frightened):\\n\\\"Hi, went up to the creepy attic and found this unexpected box. It startled me, like a big surprise mixed with a bit of fear. My spine got all shivery!\\\"\\nExplanation: The description of going to a creepy attic, finding an unexpected box, and the physical reaction of feeling shivery conveys a mix of surprise and fear, capturing the nuanced emotion of being frightened.\\nExample (Surprised):\\n\\\"Hey, opened a door! It was a big birthday party! I was so shocked and happy; it felt like a burst of joy and laughter all at once.\\\"\\nExplanation: The use of expressions like  \\\"shocked and happy,\\\" and \\\"burst of joy and laughter\\\" conveys the positive and delightful nature of the surprise, emphasizing the nuanced emotion of being pleasantly surprised.\\nJust decide the type of feeling based on above category without any explanation and output the label for example 0, 1, 3, ...\"\n",
